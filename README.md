# IntrospectiveStreams

## Objective
Inspection tools to learn about stellar streams with observations in mind.

## Background
Originally this package was called **RiosDelCosmos**.
Some files and directories were brought here starting with a fresh
commit history. To read old commits just consider that **RiosDelCosmos** was renamed
**~/casa/work/2022/OldRiosDelCosmos**.
Besides, the present package package contains some data and plotting functions originally defined in **~/casa/work/2022/dwarf-galaxies-in-S/iDR4**.
On the other hand, there is a new dev package **RiosDelCosmos.jl** which focuses in discovering stellar streams with Gaia and other surveys.
