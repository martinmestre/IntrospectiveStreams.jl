# IntrospectiveStreams

## Background
Originally this package was called **RiosDelCosmos**.
Some files and directories were brought here starting with a fresh
commit history. To read old commits just consider that **RiosDelCosmos** was renamed **OldRiosDelCosmos**. Besides, this package contains some data and plotting functions originally defined in **~/casa/work/2022/dwarf-galaxies-in-S/iDR4**.
On the other hand, there is a new package **RiosDelCosmos.jl** which focuses in discovering stellar streams with Gaia and other surveys.
