# IntrospectiveStreams

## Background
Originally this package was called \scshape{~/work/2022/RiosDelCosmos}.
Some files and directories were brought here starting with a fresh
commit history. To read old commits just consider that \scshape{RiosDelCosmos} was renamed \scshape{OldRiosDelCosmos}.
On the other hand, there is a new package \scshape{RiosDelCosmos.jl} which focuses in discovering stellar streams with Gaia and other surveys.
